# Coding Ninjas DSA Course

This is going to be a  guide for those who have some basic knowledge of DSA and cannot afford Coding Ninjas DSA course. Most of the questions icluded in the course are present on Internet absolutely free of cost.

I will try to provide link to all questions that I find useful except some very basic ones provided in course with a user friendly guide written in markdown.

**Note**

All the questions provided here are open source and  I in any manner do not aim to violate any of the copyright by Coding Ninjas or any other organisation.
